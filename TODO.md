# TODO

Miscellaneous next steps across the Voltha code base. These may not be entered
in Jira yet. Items are organized per area:
 
 
## Voltha

* Ctrl-C should reliably stop Voltha


## Chameleon

* Ctrl-C should reliably stop Voltha


## OF Agent

* Ctrl-C should reliably stop Voltha
* Make it reconnect after Voltha restarted

## CLI

* Add auto-completion for most common args like device and logical device ids
* Add consistent argument checking
* Unify code that retrieves data from gRPC
* Unify code that prints out data/response, to allow:
  * Selectable output mode:
    * JSON
    * Tabular
* Organize history per sub context so that in each context the commands 
  entered in that context will show
* Metaprogramming [BIG ONE]: Make large part of the commands come from annotations embedded in
  the protobuf files and have corresponding handler auto-generated by protoc
* Package CLI as docker container, bake it into composition
* Add commands in order of usage priority
